# Refactor Candidates

After a TDD cycle, look for:

- **Duplication** → extract a function or class.
- **Long methods** → break into private helpers (keep tests on the public interface).
- **Shallow modules** → combine or deepen.
- **Feature envy** → move logic to where the data lives.
- **Primitive obsession** → introduce value objects.
- **Existing code** that the new code reveals as problematic.
